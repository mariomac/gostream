// Stream is a sequence of elements supporting different processing and aggregation functionalities.
// To perform a computation, Stream operations are composed into a stream pipeline. A stream pipeline
// consists of a source (which might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel,
// etc), zero or more intermediate operations (which transform a stream into another stream, such as
// filter(predicate)), and a terminal operation (which produces a result or side-effect, such as
// reduce(function) or forEach(consumer)). Streams are lazy; computation on the source data is
// only performed when the terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are consumed only as
// needed.
